# Finding Needles - Better EventLog Management with PowerShell

This repository contains the session material from my presentation at Live 360\Techmentor in Orlando, Florida November 2023.

## Abstract

We all agree that event logs are valuable, but only when we can find what we need when we need it and in a timely manner. There is an art to searching an event log. Then think about trying to search event logs across hundreds of servers. In this session, PowerShell MVP and teacher Jeff Hicks will demonstrate efficient query techniques for individual event logs. Jeff will show you techniques to scale the process across your network. Finally, you'll learn how to take advantage of event subscribers and notifications.

- Learning Objective 1: Learn how to write efficient event log queries
- Learning Objective 2: Learn how to effectively scale searching across the enterprise
- Learning Objective 3: Learn how to use event subscribers
